# FSND_Logs_Analysis

## Project Overview

This repository hosts the Logs Analysis Project, a component of the Udacity Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree program. The project is designed to provide hands-on experience with analyzing web server logs using Python and SQL. It involves setting up a virtualized development environment using Vagrant and VirtualBox. The main topics covered include Python, SQL, Vagrant, and VirtualBox.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)

### Instructions

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory of the cloned repository.
3. Start the virtual machine using the command `vagrant up`.
4. Once the machine is up and running, log into it using `vagrant ssh`.
5. Navigate to the shared folder using `cd /vagrant`.
